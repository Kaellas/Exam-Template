# Exam Template
Made by **Paweł Gach** with contributions from others

1st semester Machine Learning at AU BSS

Version 0.2

---

This template is meant to be used as a hub of building blocks

When the exam is underway, read the problem, make a plan of the relevant actions your code will need to perform, then go to the respective sections (.R files) and copy the relevant code - do this a few times, and you will have created a code that should be up and running

The dataset used during the exam will be US-pumpkins and the code will refer
to simply it as "pumpkin"
